# Eye-movement modelling as a tool to foster digital competencies and misconception change when reading multiple documents in L2

## Abstract

__Background__. Misconceptions are unjustified beliefs about a topic. Nonetheless, they are pervasive among educational practitioners – which has significant implications for learning and instruction. Although the internet can be a powerful tool to learn and debunk misconceptions, their use requires competencies like navigating through search engine results page (SERPs), evaluating the reliability of content, and integrating meaning across varied perspectives. Furthermore, as most information on the internet is available in English, L2 readers might face additional barriers, limiting their possibilities to benefit from content debunking misconceptions.

__Objectives__. Our premise was that digital reading competencies could be modelled through videos of eye movements (EMMEs), which in turn would promote misconception change after reading webpages that either corroborated or debunked the Learning Styles (LS) misconception. 

__Methods__. Undergraduate students speakers of English as L2 watched EMMEs or an instructional video, read the webpages while their eye movements were recorded, wrote an essay and answered a memory task and a misconception posttest. 

__Results and Conclusions__. EMMEs had a positive effect on increased time inspecting the SERP, decreased fixation on non-reliable pages, and misconception change. No effects were found in integrated understanding, nor on source memory. Although L2 level predicted performance in the learning measures, it did not mediate the effect of EMMEs on these measures. These results confirm previous research on learning and extend the effects of EMMEs to misconception change in L2 contexts.

_Keywords_: educational misconceptions, multiple documents, EMMEs, eye-tracking, L2 reading.

## Instructions for the Argumentative Essay Task

Instructions and procedures for the Argumentative essay task were adapted from Andresen and colleagues (2019): "“The texts you have just read presented different perspectives about learning styles. Now, please write a short essay stating your informed opinion on the topic you just read about by describing and evaluating these different perspectives, supporting your arguments based on the webpages you have just visited. Write your answer in a concise and elaborate manner, using approximately half a page. Give your text a title.”
