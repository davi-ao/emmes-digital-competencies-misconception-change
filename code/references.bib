abstract = {Interventions to promote students' source evaluations have used various methods designed for the classroom context. In the present study, we tested an approach that is easily adaptable to online courses, based on eye movement modelling examples (EMME), that is, short videos displaying an expert student's eye gaze while s/he reads multiple pages on the Internet to learn about a conflicting topic. Using an eye-tracking methodology in a preâ€“post design, we analysed how an intervention using EMME changed students' attention to source information, and how this processing affected their learning. EMME increased participants' attention to the search engine results page, author information and decreased attention of texts from untrustworthy pages. In addition, EMME increased the number of participants who cited at least one document source at post-test. We discuss the potential benefits and limitations of EMME in teaching complex literacy strategies, and the importance of measuring processing data in educational research studies.},

abstract = {In this study, we present the newly developed Misconceptions about Multimedia Learning Questionnaire (MMLQ), we evaluate its psychometric properties (item difficulties, scale reliabilities, and internal structure), and we use it to examine the prevalence of four different misconceptions about multimedia learning in student teachers and teachers. A total of 311 participants (176 teachers and 135 student teachers) responded to the items of the MMLQ. The results revealed moderate reliabilities of the MMLQ scales. Moreover, an a priori assumed four-factor structure of misconceptions about multimedia learning was most compatible with teachers' and student teachers' answers to the MMLQ items. These four factors were learning styles (multimedia instruction needs to be adapted to students' learning styles [visual or auditory]), hemispheric isolation (multimedia instruction enables hemispheric communication), na{\"{i}}ve summation (multimedia instruction is more effective the more sensory channels are used), and motivation primacy (multimedia instruction is mainly effective because it is motivating). The majority of teachers and student teachers endorsed three of the four misconceptions about multimedia learning (i.e., learning styles [78.1%], hemispheric isolation [58.8%], and na{\"{i}}ve summation [81.4%]) as assessed by the MMLQ. This finding may provide valuable information for teacher education and training regarding this specific issue.},
